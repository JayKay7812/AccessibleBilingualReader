According to the "Second National Sample Survey on Persons with Disabilities" published in 2007, there are 82.96 million persons with disabilities in China. Combined with the data from the sixth national census in 2010 and the seventh national census in 2020, it is projected that there are about 87.42 million people with disabilities in China.Really? IDK ID think so...... In the information age, how to ensure that such a large number of people with disabilities can obtain information and learn from the Internet is a major problem that needs to be solved. At the same time, the data of the seventh national census shows that there are 264.02 million people over 60 years old in China, accounting for 18.70% of the total population, so how to promote the ageing of Internet applications is also a major social concern.
This is just a test paragaraph..... To be concern about? I guess :)
